Clap 0.2 - #1 Update

This update was primarily focused on fixing *very* annoying bugs. The next will feature more stuff and customization.

***

Summary:
- Bug fixes
- Changed the alarm sound

Detailed changes:
- Bug fixes:
    * Fixed music being stopped by Clap (via new "Disable When Playing Music" switch).
    * Fixed some tilted positions that prevented Clap from working properly.
    * Fixed more false-positives (ex. loud knocks on a table)
    * Completely re-written the accelerometer check system since the old one was problematic.
    * Fixed other minor problems. (re-wrote buggy code, fixed some memory issues, AudioSession loading, etc.)

- Stuff changed:
    * Added a new switch - "Disable When Ringer Switch is OFF" | Used to choose whether to disable Clap by putting the phone on silent or not.
    * Added a new switch - "Disable When Playing Music" | Used to stop Clap when playing music.
    * Changed the alarm sound since the old one was buggy and kept playing/overlapping.
